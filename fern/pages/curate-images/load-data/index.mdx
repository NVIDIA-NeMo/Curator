title: Image Data Loading
description: "Load image data for curation using tar archives with distributed processing and GPU acceleration"
---

Load image data for curation using NeMo Curator. The primary supported format is tar archives containing JPEG images, which enables efficient distributed processing of large-scale image datasets.

## How it Works

NeMo Curator's image data loading uses a pipeline-based approach optimized for large-scale, distributed curation workflows:

1. **File Partitioning**: `FilePartitioningStage` distributes `.tar` files across workers for parallel processing.

2. **High-Performance Reading**: `ImageReaderStage` uses NVIDIA DALI to accelerate image loading, decoding, and batching on GPU with CPU fallback.

3. **Tar Archive Format**: Processes sharded `.tar` archives containing JPEG images (other file types are ignored during loading).

4. **Batch Processing**: Images are processed in `ImageBatch` objects containing decoded images, metadata, and processing results.

The result is a stream of `ImageBatch` objects ready for embedding, classification, and filtering in downstream pipeline stages.
