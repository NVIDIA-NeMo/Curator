title: Process Data for Image Curation
description: "Process image data using embeddings, filters, and filtering for high-quality dataset curation"
---

Process image data you've loaded from tar archives using NeMo Curator's suite of tools. These tools help you generate embeddings, filter images, and prepare your dataset to produce high-quality data for downstream AI tasks such as generative model training, dataset analysis, or quality control.

## How it Works

Image processing in NeMo Curator follows a pipeline-based approach with these stages:

1. **Partition files** using `FilePartitioningStage` to distribute tar files
2. **Read images** using `ImageReaderStage` with DALI acceleration
3. **Generate embeddings** using `ImageEmbeddingStage` with CLIP models
4. **Apply filters** using `ImageAestheticFilterStage` and `ImageNSFWFilterStage`
5. **Save results** using `ImageWriterStage` to export curated datasets

Each stage processes `ImageBatch` objects containing images, metadata, and processing results. You can use built-in stages or create custom stages for advanced use cases.
