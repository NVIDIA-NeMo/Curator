Learn how to curate high-quality image datasets using NeMo Curator's powerful image processing pipeline. NeMo Curator enables you to efficiently process large-scale image-text datasets, applying quality filtering, content filtering, and semantic deduplication at scale.

## Use Cases

- Prepare high-quality image datasets for training generative AI models such as LLMs, VLMs, and WFMs
- Curate datasets for text-to-image model training and fine-tuning
- Process large-scale image collections for multimodal foundation model pretraining
- Apply quality control and content filtering to remove inappropriate or low-quality images
- Generate embeddings and semantic features for image search and retrieval applications
- Remove duplicate images from large datasets using semantic deduplication

## Architecture

NeMo Curator's image curation follows a modular pipeline architecture where data flows through configurable stages. Each stage performs a specific operation and passes processed data to the next stage in the pipeline.

This pipeline architecture provides:

- **Modularity**: Add, remove, or reorder stages based on your workflow needs
- **Scalability**: Distributed processing across multiple GPUs and nodes using Ray
- **Flexibility**: Configure parameters for each stage independently
- **Efficiency**: GPU-accelerated processing with DALI and CLIP models
