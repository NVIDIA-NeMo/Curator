description: "Comprehensive guide to Ray-based video curation with NeMo Curator including splitting and deduplication pipelines for large-scale processing"
---

Learn what video curation is and how you use NeMo Curator to turn long videos into high‑quality, searchable clips.
Depending on the use case, this can involve processing 100+ PB of videos.
To efficiently process this quantity of videos, NeMo Curator provides highly optimized curation pipelines.

## Use Cases

Identify when to use NeMo Curator by matching your goals to common video curation scenarios.

* Generating clips for video world model training
* Generating clips for generative video model fine-tuning
* Creating a rich video database for video retrieval applications

## Architecture

Understand how components work together so you can plan, scale, and troubleshoot video pipelines. The following diagram outlines NeMo Curator's video curation architecture:

<Note>
Video pipelines use the `XennaExecutor` backend by default, which provides optimized support for GPU-accelerated video processing including hardware decoders (`nvdecs`) and encoders (`nvencs`). You do not need to import or configure the executor unless you want to use an alternative backend. For more information about customizing backends, refer to [Add a Custom Stage](video-tutorials-pipeline-cust-add-stage).

## Curation Tasks

Follow task-based guides to load, process, and write curated video data end to end.

### Load Data

Bring videos into your pipeline from local paths or remote sources you control.

<Cards>

<Card title="Local & Cloud" href="/docs/video/load/data/local/cloud">
Load videos from local paths or S3-compatible and HTTP(S) URLs.
</Card>

<Card title="Remote (JSON)" href="/docs/video/load/data/json/list">
Provide an explicit JSON file list for remote datasets under a root prefix.
</Card>

</Cards>
### Process Data

Transform raw videos into curated clips, frames, embeddings, and metadata you can use.

<Cards>

<Card title="Clip Videos" href="/docs/video/process/clipping">
