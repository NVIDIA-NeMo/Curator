> The up to date documentation on running the Fuzzy Deduplication scripts can be found in the [NeMo-User guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/nemo-framework/user-guide/latest/datacuration/gpudeduplication.html#id4). It is recommended to use the Python API directly rather than the CLI scripts for most cases.
