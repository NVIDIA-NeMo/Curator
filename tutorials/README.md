# NeMo Curator Tutorials

The following is a set of tutorials that demonstrate various functionalities and features of NeMo Curator. These tutorials are meant to provide the coding foundation for building applications that consume the data that NeMo Curator curates.

Tutorials are split by modality: audio, image, text, or video. Please refer to each subdirectory for more information.

Within this directory, we include a `quickstart.py` which does not reference a specific modality but instead provides a high-level example of how to define and use `Task`, `ProcessingStage`, and `Pipeline` objects, which are the core data structures in NeMo Curator. It is meant to serve as a lightweight example for how these objects interact with each other and help expose the skeleton which all Curator modalities are built upon.
