    "This notebooks outlines one of many usecases for synthetic data. This notebook guides you through the process of generating questions with which you can evaluate an Retrieval Pipeline. Let's get started.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we start generating the data, let's align on the larger process - To evaluate a retriever, you need two things, questions & the ground truth. From a synthetic data perspective we are flipping the problem on its head. We can start with a few documents, create chunks and then create questions that can be answered using those chunks. In this manner, we already know the chunks for each question and can create the evaluation pairs. If you want to learn more about naunces of evaluating retrieval pipelines, please do check out [this article](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/evaluating-retriever-for-enterprise-grade-rag/).\n",
