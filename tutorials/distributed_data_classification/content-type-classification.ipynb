    "# Distributed Data Classification with NeMo Curator's `ContentTypeClassifier`\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the use of NeMo Curator's `ContentTypeClassifier`. The [content type classifier](https://huggingface.co/nvidia/content-type-classifier-deberta) is used to categorize documents into one of 11 distinct speech types based on their content. It helps with data annotation, which is useful in data blending for foundation model training. Please refer to the NemoCurator Content Type Classifier DeBERTa Hugging Face page for more information about the content type classifier, including its output labels, here: https://huggingface.co/nvidia/content-type-classifier-deberta.\n",
    "\n",
    "The content type classifier is accelerated using [CrossFit](https://github.com/rapidsai/crossfit), a library that leverages intellegent batching and RAPIDS to accelerate the offline inference on large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before running this notebook, please see this [Getting Started](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo-Curator?tab=readme-ov-file#get-started) page for instructions on how to install NeMo Curator."
