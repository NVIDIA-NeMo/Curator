    "This notebook demonstrates the use of NeMo Curator's `FineWebEduClassifier`. The [FineWeb-Edu classifier](https://huggingface.co/HuggingFaceFW/fineweb-edu-classifier) is used for judging the educational value of web pages. It helps with data annotation, which is useful in data blending for foundation model training. Please refer to the Hugging Face page for more information about the FineWeb-Edu classifier here: https://huggingface.co/HuggingFaceFW/fineweb-edu-classifier.\n",
