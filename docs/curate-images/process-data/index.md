# Process Data for Image Curation

Process image data you've loaded into a WebDataset using NeMo Curator's suite of tools. These tools help you generate embeddings, classify images, and filter your dataset to prepare high-quality data for downstream AI tasks such as generative model training, dataset analysis, or quality control.

## How it Works

Image processing in NeMo Curator follows a pipeline-based approach with these stages:

1. **Partition files** using `FilePartitioningStage` to distribute WebDataset tar files
2. **Read images** using `ImageReaderStage` with DALI acceleration
3. **Generate embeddings** using `ImageEmbeddingStage` with CLIP models
4. **Apply classifiers** using `ImageAestheticFilterStage` and `ImageNSFWFilterStage`
5. **Save results** using `ImageWriterStage` to export curated datasets

Each stage processes `ImageBatch` objects containing images, metadata, and processing results. You can use built-in stages or create custom stages for advanced use cases.

## Filtering Images

The classification stages (`ImageAestheticFilterStage`, `ImageNSFWFilterStage`) include filtering capabilities. Images that don't meet the specified thresholds are automatically filtered out during processing.

**Built-in filtering capabilities:**

* **Aesthetic filtering**: Remove images with low aesthetic scores using `ImageAestheticFilterStage`
* **NSFW filtering**: Remove inappropriate content using `ImageNSFWFilterStage`
* **Automatic processing**: Filtering happens during the pipeline execution

### Pipeline with filtering

```python
from nemo_curator.stages.image.filters.aesthetic_filter import ImageAestheticFilterStage
from nemo_curator.stages.image.filters.nsfw_filter import ImageNSFWFilterStage

# Filter by aesthetic quality (keep images with score >= 0.5)
pipeline.add_stage(ImageAestheticFilterStage(
    model_dir="/models",
    score_threshold=0.5,  # Minimum aesthetic score
    num_gpus_per_worker=0.25,
))

# Filter NSFW content (keep images with score < 0.5)
pipeline.add_stage(ImageNSFWFilterStage(
    model_dir="/models", 
    score_threshold=0.5,  # Maximum NSFW score (images below this are kept)
    num_gpus_per_worker=0.25,
))
```

For custom filtering logic, you can create your own stage by extending `ProcessingStage[ImageBatch, ImageBatch]`.
