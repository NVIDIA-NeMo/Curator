# NeMo Curator Release Notes: {{ current_release }}

This major release represents a fundamental architecture shift from [Dask](https://www.dask.org/) to [Ray](https://www.ray.io/), expanding NeMo Curator to support multimodal data curation with new [video](../../curate-video/index.md) and [audio](../../curate-audio/index.md) capabilities. This refactor enables unified backend processing, better heterogeneous computing support, and enhanced autoscaling for dynamic workloads.

**Migrating from a previous version of NeMo Curator?** Refer to the {ref}`Migration Guide <migration-guide>` for step-by-step instructions and the {ref}`Migration FAQ <migration-faq>` for common questions.

## Installation Updates

- **New Docker container**: Updated Docker infrastructure with CUDA 12.8.1 and Ubuntu 24.04 base; obtainable through the [NGC Catalog](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/containers/nemo-curator) (`nvcr.io/nvidia/nemo-curator:{{ container_version }}`)
- **Docker file to build own image**: Simplified [Dockerfile](https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/Curator/blob/main/docker/Dockerfile) structure for custom container builds with FFmpeg support
- **UV source installations**: Integrated UV package manager (v0.8.22) for faster dependency management
- **PyPI improvements**: Enhanced PyPI installation with modular extras for targeted functionality:

## New Modalities

### Video

NeMo Curator now supports comprehensive [video data curation](../../curate-video/index.md) with distributed processing capabilities:

- **Video splitting**: [Fixed-stride](../../curate-video/process-data/clipping.md) and [scene-change detection (TransNetV2)](../../curate-video/process-data/clipping.md) for clip extraction
- **Semantic deduplication**: [K-means clustering and pairwise similarity](../../curate-video/process-data/dedup.md) for near-duplicate clip removal
- **Content filtering**: [Motion-based filtering](../../curate-video/process-data/filtering.md) and [aesthetic filtering](../../curate-video/process-data/filtering.md) for quality improvement
- **Embedding generation**: InternVideo2 and Cosmos-Embed1 models for clip-level embeddings
- **Enhanced captioning**: [VL-based caption generation with optional LLM-based rewriting](../../curate-video/process-data/captions-preview.md) (Qwen-VL and Qwen-LM supported) for detailed video descriptions
- **Ray-based distributed architecture**: Scalable video processing with [autoscaling support](../concepts/video/architecture.md)

### Audio

New [audio curation capabilities](../../curate-audio/index.md) for speech data processing:

- **ASR inference**: [Automatic speech recognition](../../curate-audio/process-data/asr-inference/index.md) using NeMo Framework pretrained models
- **Quality assessment**: [Word Error Rate (WER) and Character Error Rate (CER)](../../curate-audio/process-data/quality-assessment/index.md) calculation
- **Speech metrics**: [Duration analysis and speech rate metrics](../../curate-audio/process-data/audio-analysis/index.md) (words/characters per second)
- **Text integration**: Seamless integration with [text curation workflows](../../curate-audio/process-data/text-integration/index.md) via `AudioToDocumentStage`
- **Manifest support**: JSONL manifest format for audio file management

## Modality Refactors

### Text

- **Ray backend migration**: Complete transition from Dask to Ray for distributed [text processing](../../curate-text/index.md)
- **Improved model-based classifier throughput**: Better overlapping of compute between tokenization and inference through [length-based sequence sorting](../../curate-text/process-data/quality-assessment/distributed-classifier.md) for optimal GPU memory utilization
- **Task-centric architecture**: New `Task`-based processing model for finer-grained control
- **Pipeline redesign**: Updated `ProcessingStage` and `Pipeline` architecture with resource specification

### Image

- **Pipeline-based architecture**: Transitioned from legacy `ImageTextPairDataset` to modern [stage-based processing](../../curate-images/index.md) with `ImageReaderStage`, `ImageEmbeddingStage`, and filter stages
- **DALI-based image loading**: New `ImageReaderStage` uses NVIDIA DALI for high-performance WebDataset tar shard processing with GPU/CPU fallback
- **Modular processing stages**: Separate stages for [embedding generation](../../curate-images/process-data/embeddings/index.md), [aesthetic filtering](../../curate-images/process-data/filters/aesthetic.md), and [NSFW filtering](../../curate-images/process-data/filters/nsfw.md)
- **Task-based data flow**: Images processed as `ImageBatch` tasks containing `ImageObject` instances with metadata, embeddings, and classification scores

## Deduplication Improvements

Enhanced deduplication capabilities across all modalities with improved performance and flexibility:

- **Exact and Fuzzy deduplication**: Updated [rapidsmpf-based shuffle backend](../../reference/infrastructure/gpu-processing.md) for more efficient GPU-to-GPU data transfer and better spilling capabilities
- **Semantic deduplication**: Support for deduplicating [text](../../curate-text/process-data/deduplication/semdedup.md) and [video](../../curate-video/process-data/dedup.md) datasets using unified embedding-based workflows
- **New ranking strategies**: Added `RankingStrategy` which allows you to rank elements within cluster centers to decide which point to prioritize during duplicate removal, supporting [metadata-based ranking](../../curate-text/process-data/deduplication/semdedup.md) to prioritize specific datasets or inputs

## Core Refactors

The architecture refactor introduces a layered system with unified interfaces and multiple execution backends:
