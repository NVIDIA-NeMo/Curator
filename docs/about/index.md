# Overview of NeMo Curator

NeMo Curator is an open-source, enterprise-grade platform for scalable, privacy-aware data curation across text, image, and video modalities.

NeMo Curator, part of the NVIDIA NeMo software suite for managing the AI agent lifecycle, helps you prepare high-quality, compliant datasets for large language model (LLM) and generative artificial intelligence (AI) training. Whether you work in the cloud, on-premises, or in a hybrid environment, NeMo Curator supports your workflow.

## Target Users

- **Data scientists and machine learning engineers**: Build and curate datasets for LLMs, generative models, and multimodal AI.
- **Cluster administrators and DevOps professionals**: Deploy and scale curation pipelines on Kubernetes or Slurm clusters.
- **Researchers**: Experiment with new data curation techniques, synthetic data generation, and ablation studies.
- **Enterprises**: Ensure data privacy, compliance, and quality for production AI workflows.

## How It Works

NeMo Curator speeds up data curation by using modern hardware and distributed computing frameworks. You can process data efficientlyâ€”from a single laptop to a multi-node GPU cluster. With modular pipelines, advanced filtering, and easy integration with machine learning operations (MLOps) tools, NeMo Curator is trusted by leading organizations.

- **Text Curation**: Data flows through loaders and processors (cleaning, filtering, deduplication), and exporters, all built atop Dask for distributed execution.
- **Image Curation**: Uses WebDataset sharding, NVIDIA Data Loading Library (DALI) for GPU-accelerated loading, and modular steps for embedding, classification, filtering, and export.

### Key Technologies

- **Graphics Processing Units (GPUs)**: Accelerate data processing for large-scale workloads.
- **Distributed Computing**: Supports frameworks like Dask, RAPIDS, and Ray for scalable, parallel processing.
- **Modular Pipelines**: Build, customize, and scale curation workflows to fit your needs.
- **MLOps Integration**: Seamlessly connects with modern MLOps environments for production-ready workflows.
