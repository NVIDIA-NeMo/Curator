# Architecture

NeMo Curator's video curation system builds on Ray, a distributed computing framework that enables scalable, high-throughput data processing across clusters of machines.

## Ray Foundation

NeMo Curator leverages two essential Ray Core capabilities:

- **Distributed Actor Management**: Creates and manages Ray actors across a cluster. Cosmos-Xenna supports per-stage runtime environments. In Curator today, per-stage `runtime_env` is not user-configurable through stage specs; the integration sets only limited executor-level environment variables.
- **Ray Object Store and References**: Uses Ray's object store and data references to reduce data movement and increase throughput.

## Execution and Auto Scaling

Curator runs pipelines through an executor. The Cosmos-Xenna executor (`XennaExecutor`) translates `ProcessingStage` definitions into Cosmos-Xenna stage specifications and runs them on Ray in either streaming or batch mode. During streaming execution, the auto-scaling mechanism:

- Monitors each stage's throughput
- Dynamically adjusts worker allocation
- Optimizes pipeline performance by balancing resources across stages

This dynamic scaling reduces bottlenecks and uses hardware efficiently for large-scale video curation tasks.

Key executor configuration (actual keys):

- `logging_interval`: Seconds between status logs (default: 60)
- `ignore_failures`: Continue on failures (default: False)
- `execution_mode`: "streaming" or "batch" (default: "streaming")
- `cpu_allocation_percentage`: CPU allocation ratio (default: 0.95)
- `autoscale_interval_s`: Auto-scaling interval in seconds (applies in streaming mode; default: 180)

Use `Pipeline.describe()` to review stage resources and input/output requirements at a glance during development.

### Other Executors

While `XennaExecutor` is the default and recommended backend for video pipelines, Curator also includes experimental Ray-based executors for advanced use cases:

- `RayDataExecutor` (experimental)
- `RayActorPoolExecutor` (experimental)

Refer to the execution backends reference for details and current status.
