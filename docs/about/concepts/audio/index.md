# Audio Curation Concepts

This document covers the essential concepts for audio data curation in NVIDIA NeMo Curator. These concepts assume basic familiarity with speech processing and machine learning principles.

## Core Concept Areas

Audio curation in NVIDIA NeMo Curator focuses on these key areas:
