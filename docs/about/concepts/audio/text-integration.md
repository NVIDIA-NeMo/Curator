# Audio-Text Integration Concepts

Understanding how audio processing integrates with text curation workflows in NeMo Curator, enabling seamless multimodal data preparation and cross-modal quality assessment.

## Integration Architecture

Audio-text integration in NeMo Curator operates on multiple levels:

### Data Structure Integration

**Format Conversion**: `AudioBatch` → `DocumentBatch`
- Fields are preserved without remapping (`text` and `pred_text` remain unchanged)
- Audio metadata preserved as additional fields

**Metadata Preservation**: Audio characteristics maintained during conversion
- File paths for traceability
- Quality metrics (WER, duration) for filtering
- Audio-specific metadata for downstream use

### Pipeline Integration

**Sequential Processing**: Audio → Text → Multimodal
```
Audio Files → ASR → Transcriptions → Text Processing → Integrated Output
```

**Parallel Processing**: Simultaneous audio and text analysis
```
Audio Files → ASR ↘
                   → Quality Assessment → Filtered Output  
Text Data → Text Processing ↗
```

## Cross-Modal Quality Assessment

### Audio-Informed Text Quality

Use audio characteristics to enhance text quality assessment:

**Speech Rate Analysis**: Detect unnaturally fast or slow speech
- Normal rate: 2-4 words per second
- Very fast: > 6 words per second (potential quality issues)
- Very slow: < 1 word per second (potential incomplete utterances)

**Duration-Text Consistency**: Ensure transcription length matches audio duration
- Short audio with long text: Potential transcription errors
- Long audio with short text: Potential missing content
- Optimal ratio: ~3-5 characters per second of audio

### Text-Informed Audio Quality

Use text characteristics to assess audio quality:

**Transcription Completeness**: Detect incomplete or truncated speech
- Sentence fragments without proper endings
- Unusual punctuation patterns
- Incomplete words or phrases

**Content Coherence**: Assess semantic consistency
- Logical flow and coherence in transcriptions
- Domain-appropriate vocabulary usage
- Language consistency throughout sample

## Workflow Patterns

### Audio-First Workflows

Start with audio processing, then apply text curation:

```text
# Audio-first pipeline pattern
audio_first_workflow = [
    # Audio processing stages
    "Load Audio" →
    "ASR Inference" →
    "Audio Quality Assessment" →
    "Audio Filtering" →
    
    # Convert to text format
    "AudioBatch → DocumentBatch" →
    
    # Text processing stages
    "Text Quality Assessment" →
    "Text Filtering" →
    "Text Enhancement"
]
```

**Use Cases**:
- Speech dataset curation for ASR training
- Podcast transcription and processing
- Lecture and educational content preparation

### Text-First Workflows

Start with text processing, then validate with audio:

```text
# Text-first pipeline pattern  
text_first_workflow = [
    # Text processing stages
    "Load Text Corpus" →
    "Text Quality Assessment" →
    "Text Filtering" →
    
    # Audio validation stages
    "Match with Audio Files" →
    "ASR Inference" →
    "Cross-Modal Validation" →
    "Consistency Filtering"
]
```

**Use Cases**:
- Validating existing transcriptions with audio
- Creating audio-text pairs from separate sources
- Quality control for crowdsourced transcriptions

### Parallel Workflows

Process audio and text simultaneously:

```text
# Parallel processing pattern
parallel_workflow = {
    "audio_branch": [
        "Load Audio" → "ASR Inference" → "Audio Metrics"
    ],
    "text_branch": [
        "Load Text" → "Text Processing" → "Text Metrics"  
    ],
    "integration": [
        "Merge Branches" → "Cross-Modal Assessment" → "Final Filtering"
    ]
}
```

**Use Cases**:
- Large-scale multimodal dataset creation
- Independent quality assessment of audio and text
- Parallel processing for performance optimization

## Data Flow Concepts

### Conversion Mechanisms

**AudioBatch to DocumentBatch**:
```python
# Conversion preserves all metadata
audio_data = {
    "audio_filepath": "/audio.wav",
    "text": "ground truth", 
    "pred_text": "asr prediction",
    "wer": 15.2,
    "duration": 3.4
}

# Becomes DocumentBatch with the same fields preserved
document_data = {
    "audio_filepath": "/audio.wav",
    "text": "ground truth",
    "pred_text": "asr prediction",
    "wer": 15.2,
    "duration": 3.4
}
```

Note: A built-in `DocumentBatch` → `AudioBatch` conversion stage is not provided. Implement a custom stage if reverse conversion is required.

### Metadata Flow

**Additive Processing**: Stages commonly add metadata without removing existing fields

```python
# Stage 1: Initial loading
stage1_output = {"audio_filepath": "/audio.wav", "text": "transcription"}

# Stage 2: ASR inference  
stage2_output = {**stage1_output, "pred_text": "asr result"}

# Stage 3: Quality assessment
stage3_output = {**stage2_output, "wer": 15.2, "duration": 3.4}

# Stage 4: Text processing (after conversion)
stage4_output = {**stage3_output, "word_count": 6, "language": "en"}
```

## Quality Consistency Concepts

### Cross-Modal Validation

Ensure consistency between audio and text quality:

**Transcription-Audio Alignment**:
- WER correlates with audio quality
- Duration matches transcription length
- Language detection consistency

**Quality Threshold Coordination**:
- Audio quality thresholds inform text filtering
- Text quality metrics validate audio processing
- Combined quality scores for integrated assessment

### Multimodal Quality Metrics

**Composite Quality Scoring**:
Conceptual example (not a built-in stage):
```python
composite_quality = (
    0.4 * audio_quality_score +      # ASR accuracy, duration appropriateness
    0.4 * text_quality_score +       # Text coherence, length, language
    0.2 * consistency_score          # Audio-text alignment
)
```

**Quality Dimensions**:
- **Technical Quality**: File integrity, format compliance, duration
- **Content Quality**: Transcription accuracy, semantic coherence
- **Consistency Quality**: Audio-text alignment, cross-modal validation

## Performance and Scaling

### Memory Considerations

**AudioBatch Memory Usage**:
- Metadata storage scales linearly with batch size
- Audio files loaded on-demand, not cached in memory
- Large batches increase processing efficiency but consume more RAM

**Conversion Overhead**:
- AudioBatch → DocumentBatch conversion is lightweight
- Metadata copying has minimal performance impact
- Batch size affects conversion performance

### Processing Efficiency

**Sequential vs. Parallel Integration**:

**Sequential**: Audio → Text (lower memory, slower)
```text
# Process audio completely, then text
audio_pipeline.run() → text_pipeline.run()
```

**Parallel**: Audio ∥ Text (higher memory, faster)
```python
# Run a single pipeline that includes both audio and text stages using an executor
from nemo_curator.pipeline import Pipeline
from nemo_curator.backends.xenna import XennaExecutor

pipeline = Pipeline(name="audio_text")
# ... add audio and text stages ...
results = pipeline.run(XennaExecutor())
```

### Scaling Strategies

**Horizontal Scaling**: Distribute across multiple workers
- Partition audio files across workers
- Independent processing with final aggregation
- Load balancing based on audio duration

**Vertical Scaling**: Optimize single-machine performance
- GPU acceleration for ASR inference
- Batch size optimization for hardware
- Memory management for large datasets

## Design Principles

### Modularity

**Separation of Concerns**: Audio and text processing remain independent
- Audio stages focus on speech-specific operations
- Text stages handle language processing
- Integration stages manage cross-modal operations

**Composability**: Mix and match audio and text processing stages
- Flexible pipeline construction
- Reusable stage components
- Configurable integration points

### Extensibility

**Custom Integration Patterns**: Support for domain-specific workflows
- Custom conversion logic
- Specialized quality metrics
- Domain-specific filtering rules

**Plugin Architecture**: Easy addition of new integration methods
- Custom stage implementations
- External tool integration
- Specialized format support
