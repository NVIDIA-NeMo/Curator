# Deduplication Concepts

This guide covers deduplication techniques available across all modalities in NeMo Curator, from exact hash-based matching to semantic similarity detection using embeddings.

## Overview

Deduplication is a critical step in data curation that removes duplicate and near-duplicate content to improve model training efficiency. NeMo Curator provides sophisticated deduplication capabilities that work across text, image, and video modalities.

Removing duplicates offers several benefits:

- **Improved Training Efficiency**: Prevents overrepresentation of repeated content
- **Reduced Dataset Size**: Significantly reduces storage and processing requirements
- **Better Model Performance**: Eliminates redundant examples that can bias training

## Deduplication Approaches

NeMo Curator implements three main deduplication strategies, each with different strengths and use cases:

### Exact Deduplication

- **Method**: Hash-based matching (MD5)
- **Best For**: Identical copies and character-for-character matches
- **Speed**: Very fast
- **GPU Required**: Yes (for distributed processing)

Exact deduplication identifies documents or media files that are completely identical by computing cryptographic hashes of their content.

**Modalities Supported**: Text, Image, Video

### Fuzzy Deduplication

- **Method**: MinHash and Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH)
- **Best For**: Near-duplicates with minor changes (reformatting, small edits)
- **Speed**: Fast
- **GPU Required**: Yes

Fuzzy deduplication uses statistical fingerprinting to identify content that is nearly identical but may have small variations like formatting changes or minor edits.

**Modalities Supported**: Text

### Semantic Deduplication

- **Method**: Embedding-based similarity using neural networks
- **Best For**: Content with similar meaning but different expression
- **Speed**: Moderate (requires embedding generation)
- **GPU Required**: Yes

Semantic deduplication leverages deep learning embeddings to identify content that conveys similar meaning despite using different words, visual elements, or presentation.

**Modalities Supported**: Text, Image, Video

## Multimodal Applications

### Text Deduplication

Text deduplication is the most mature implementation, offering all three approaches:

- **Exact**: Remove identical documents using MD5 hashing
- **Fuzzy**: Remove near-duplicates using MinHash and LSH similarity
- **Semantic**: Remove semantically similar content using embeddings

Text deduplication can handle web-scale datasets and is commonly used for:

- Web crawl data (Common Crawl)
- Academic papers (ArXiv)
- Code repositories
- General text corpora

### Video Deduplication

Video deduplication uses the semantic deduplication workflow with video embeddings:

- **Semantic Clustering**: Uses the general K-means clustering workflow on video embeddings
- **Pairwise Similarity**: Computes within-cluster similarity using the semantic deduplication pipeline
- **Representative Selection**: Leverages the semantic workflow to identify and remove redundant content

Video deduplication is particularly effective for:

- Educational content with similar presentations
- News clips covering the same events
- Entertainment content with repeated segments

### Image Deduplication

Image deduplication capabilities focus on removing duplicate images from datasets:

- **Duplicate Removal**: Filters out images identified as duplicates from previous deduplication stages
- **Integration Support**: Works with image processing pipelines through `ImageBatch` tasks

## Architecture and Performance

### Distributed Processing

All deduplication workflows leverage distributed computing frameworks:

- **Ray Backend**: Provides scalable distributed processing
- **GPU Acceleration**: Essential for embedding generation and similarity computation
- **Memory Optimization**: Streaming processing for large datasets

## Implementation Patterns

### Workflow-Based Processing

NeMo Curator provides high-level workflows that encapsulate the complete deduplication process:

```python
# Text exact deduplication
from nemo_curator.stages.deduplication.exact.workflow import ExactDeduplicationWorkflow

# Text fuzzy deduplication  
from nemo_curator.stages.deduplication.fuzzy.workflow import FuzzyDeduplicationWorkflow

# Text semantic deduplication
from nemo_curator.stages.deduplication.semantic.workflow import SemanticDeduplicationWorkflow
```

### Stage-Based Processing

For fine-grained control, individual stages can be composed into custom pipelines:

```python
# Video semantic deduplication stages
from nemo_curator.stages.deduplication.semantic.kmeans import KMeansStage
from nemo_curator.stages.deduplication.semantic.pairwise import PairwiseStage
from nemo_curator.stages.deduplication.semantic.identify_duplicates import IdentifyDuplicatesStage
```

## Integration with Pipeline Architecture

Deduplication integrates seamlessly with NeMo Curator's pipeline-based architecture:

1. **Input Compatibility**: Works with `DocumentBatch` tasks from any data loading stage
2. **Output Integration**: Produces standardized outputs for downstream processing
3. **Chaining Support**: Can be combined with filtering and cleaning stages
4. **Executor Support**: Compatible with all distributed execution backends
