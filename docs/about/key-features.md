# Key Features

NeMo Curator is an enterprise-grade platform for scalable, privacy-aware data curation across text, image, video, and audio. It empowers teams to prepare high-quality, compliant datasets for LLM and AI training, with robust support for distributed, cloud-native, and on-premises workflows. Leading organizations trust NeMo Curator for its modular pipelines, advanced filtering, and seamless integration with modern MLOps environments.

## Why NeMo Curator?

- Trusted by leading organizations for LLM and generative AI data curation
- Open source, NVIDIA-supported, and actively maintained
- Seamless integration with enterprise MLOps and data platforms (Kubernetes, Slurm)
- Proven at scale: from laptops to multi-node GPU clusters

### Benchmarks & Results

- **Deduplicated 1.96 trillion tokens in 0.5 hours** using 32 NVIDIA H100 GPUs (RedPajama V2 scale)
- Up to **80% data reduction** and significant improvements in downstream model performance (see ablation studies)
- Efficient curation of Common Crawl: from 2.8TB raw to 0.52TB high-quality data in under 38 hours on 30 CPU nodes
